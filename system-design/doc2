1) Zookeeper :- can help services find each other by keeping track of registered names, addresses, ports, etc.

2) DB Scaling Technique - Federation :- Federation (or functional partitioning) splits up databases by function. 
  For example, instead of a single, monolithic database, you could have three databases: forums, users, and products.
  Adv :- Index size reduces, Each can have its own cache, less traffic to each db as compared to onw whole, write requests can be in parallel and no need to serialize.
  Disadv :- Joining tables across db using a server link.

3) DB Scaling Technique - Denormalization :- Redundant copies of the data are written in multiple tables to avoid expensive joins.
  attemps to improve read performance at the expense of some write performance
  
4) SQL Tuning
  Columns that you are querying (SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN) could be faster with indices.
  Indices are usually represented as self-balancing B-tree that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
  When loading large amounts of data, it might be faster to disable indices, load the data, then rebuild the indices.
  Denormalize where performance demands it and avoid joins.
  Break up a table by putting hot spots in a separate table to help keep it in memory.

5) NoSQL
  Data is denormalized, and joins are generally done in the application code. 
  Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions and favor eventual consistency.
  Document Store :- key-value store with documents (xml, json, binary) stored as values.
    Document stores provide APIs or a query language to query based on the internal structure of the document itself.
  WideColumn :-  nested map ColumnFamily<RowKey, Columns<ColKey, Value, Timestamp>>
    A wide column store's basic unit of data is a column (name/value pair). A column can be grouped in column families (analogous to a SQL table). Super column families further group column families. You can access each column independently with a row key, and columns with the same row key form a row. Each value contains a timestamp for versioning and for conflict resolution.
    Google introduced Bigtable as the first wide column store, which influenced the open-source HBase often-used in the Hadoop ecosystem, and Cassandra from Facebook. 
    They are often used for very large data sets.
  Graph :- each node is a record and each arc is a relationship between two nodes.
